A Day in the Park
The sun shines brightly, warming the green grass underfoot.
Children run across the playground, their laughter filling the air.
A small dog barks happily as it chases a bouncing red ball.
An old man sits on a wooden bench, feeding breadcrumbs to pigeons.
Two friends share ice cream while chatting about their weekend plans.
The smell of freshly cut grass mixes with the scent of blooming roses.
A cyclist speeds past, ringing his bell to warn pedestrians.
Clouds drift lazily across the sky, occasionally hiding the sun.
A young artist sketches the scenery, capturing the peaceful moment.
As evening falls, people slowly leave, and the park grows quiet.
